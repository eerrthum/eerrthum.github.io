style='font-size:11.0pt'>Prerequisite: </span></b><span style='font-size:11.0pt'>Passing
grade in Linear Algebra (MATH242), some sort of Discrete Math course, and
something called “mathematical maturity”. This is a term that loosely means one
has been exposed to mathematics beyond the realm of Calculus.</span></p>

style='font-size:11.0pt'>About This Course:     </span></b><span
style='font-size:11.0pt'>Mathematics has two sides to it. The first side,
sometimes called Computational or Applied Math, is one that you’re probably
very familiar with. Most of the classes you’ve probably taken so far have
mainly focused on how to get an answer, whether it is a number, function, or an
equation. This is the side of math that usually appeals to Engineers,
Physicists, and other physical scientists who are looking for answers in the
“real world”. The other side of mathematics is sometimes called Theoretical or
Pure Math. In this area of mathematics the focus is on using deductive logic to
construct and communicate sound, rigorous arguments while striving for
abstraction and the recognition of underlying structure. This area of
mathematics is beneficial to those who wish to study Law, Philosophy, or, of
course, higher Mathematics. This course, specifically, will focus on the
written mathematical proof with the goal of training students how to make
mathematical arguments. This course can serve as an introduction to the other
Pure Math courses in the WSU curriculum (specifically MATH448 and MATH453). </span></p>

style='font-size:11.0pt'>Expectations:   </span></b><span style='font-size:

be able to demonstrate the following skills: (i) Mastery of prerequisite
material, (ii) Use technology (e.g. LaTeX) to correctly format mathematical
writing, (iii) Demonstrate knowledge (i.e. memorization) of pertinent
definitions and theorems, (iv) Reason deductively in a variety of proof forms,
(v) Communicate mathematics correctly, clearly, and concisely.</span></p>

document appropriately (e.g. using the correct names and numbers of theorems,
propositions, etc.) You should be reading both the .pdf version of the lexicon
(to find new examples/problems to work on, to study definitions/theorems, etc.)

worked out, follow the link, enter your name, and check the appropriate box and
click submit. I will receive an email notification that you have done so, but
your name will remain anonymous on the sign-up sheet. Once you’ve made a
reservation, you have until 8am on the morning of the next class day to upload
the solution to the D2L assignment folder. If the 8am deadline passes without
the corresponding upload, the student who made the reservation will be
penalized 5 reputation points. In other words, don’t sign up for a problem
until you have a solution at least sketched out. For the first couple weeks of
class, <b><u>students are limited to having less than 2 problem reservations
and less than or equal to 1 example reservation at any time.</u></b></span></p>

style='font-size:11.0pt'>Solutions:         </span></b><span style='font-size:
11.0pt'>The solution should be typed up in LaTeX using notation consistent with
what’s been used previously in class and in the class lexicon. Problem set-ups
should be rephrased into mathematical statements. (For example, if a problem
says, “Problem 3.2: Prove or disprove that the square of a real number is
positive,” then your solution should start by stating “Proposition 3.2: If x is
a real number, then x<sup>2</sup> is nonnegative.”) References to previous
definitions, propositions, problems, etc. and should be explicitly documented.
Work originating from an external source should also be explicitly documented.
Solutions/Examples may not use information, definitions, etc. that occur <i><u>after</u></i>
the statement of the problem. Solutions/Examples may use previous unsolved
Problems but you must state explicitly that your argument also requires the
solution to the previous problem. (If, for instance, you know a friend has/will
submit a solution to that problem, your submission may operate under that
assumption.) Before a reservation expires, students should upload <b><i><u>both</u></i></b>
the .tex file <i><u>and</u></i> the compiled .pdf file containing the proposed
solution. Make sure to <b><u>name your files with the problem or example number</u></b>.</span></p>

for installing and getting started with LaTeX, as well as templates and the
first assignment, can be <a href="../LaTeX/index.htm">found here</a>. Other
LaTeX resources can be found within the .tex version of the class lexicon in
D2L. Note: Graphics and images are a pain to do in LaTeX. Typically another
program is used to create the image and then that is imported into LaTeX.
Likewise, feel free to use any program you want to create an image file to be
uploaded with your solution. Make sure the file extension of the image is .jpg,
.bmp, .pdf, or .gif. If you’re having trouble with graphics, see the instructor
for help.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:8.0pt;text-align:justify'><b><span
style='font-size:11.0pt'>Co-authors:</span></b><span style='font-size:11.0pt'>     Working
together is not discouraged. In fact, you are encouraged to discuss problems,
solutions, and examples with classmates prior to submitting them. If you’re
unsure of your work, the best thing to do is show it to someone else to see if
they can understand what you’re doing. Additionally, groups of up to 3 students
may submit a joint written problem solution (but not example). To submit as a
group, list everyone in the group when making the online reservation. (Later
additions to the group will not be allowed.) If <i>n</i> people are in a group,
this reservation will only count for 1/<i>n</i> towards the 1 reservation
maximum. (E.g. if you are part of a group of 3 reservation, this counts as 1/3
of a reservation, so you have room for a solo reservation since 4/3 &lt; 2.) In
addition, <b><i><u>each author</u></i></b> must upload a copy of the solution
to the D2L assignment folder. Any member of the group not uploading a copy of
the solution by the 8am deadline will be removed from the group. If Accepted or
Conditionally Accepted, this work may be added to the student’s Final Portfolio
and will count towards their Contributed Written Work, however any reputation
gained will be equally divided among the authors. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:8.0pt;text-align:justify'><b><span
style='font-size:11.0pt'>Standard Rubric:        </span></b><span
style='font-size:11.0pt'>Most written problem solutions will be shown in class
and discussed. Authors of solutions may remain anonymous during the discussion
or they may defend their work. Ultimately the solution will be graded using the
standard rubric that can be found in D2L. Each row will receive a score from
the instructor between 0 – 3 points (half points allowed) and the total will be
reported back to the author. A written solution’s status will mostly be
determined by the instructor’s score (these are guidelines, not definite
cut-offs):</span></p>

score of 4 or lower: Rejected</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:8.0pt'><span style='font-size:11.0pt'>Solutions
that are Accepted and/or Conditionally Accepted will be entered into the class
lexicon. A student’s top fifteen solution scores will constitute the
“Contributed Written Work” portion of their grade. If a student contributes
less than fifteen solutions, zeroes will be used in place of the missing
scores. To ensure that you are creating a solid Final Portfolio, each student
should be submitting <b><u>at least one example or problem solution for each
1.5 class periods</u></b>. Some mathematical writing tips can be found in the
document “MathematicalWriting.pdf” located in the content section of D2L.</span></p>

submission according to the rubric and report a total score to the instructor

style='font-size:11.0pt'>Examples/Corollaries:</span></b><span
style='font-size:11.0pt'>  Most definitions will also come with the chance for
students to create examples. Similar to problems, appropriate rewording should
be done by the student so that it can be directly copied into the lexicon. (For
example, if the lexicon originally states, “Example 2.3: Give an example of a
prime factorization containing 5 different primes,” then the example submission
should start “Example 2.3: Consider the integer 2310. … .”) Submitting an
example will follow the same procedure as a problem solution (reservation,
assignment folder submission, in-class discussion) but will not be graded
according to the rubric. Instead the class (with possible instructor veto) will
decide whether or not to accept the example into the lexicon (with revise/resubmit
as a middle option). Type-setting issues will not prohibit an example from
being accepted, however a lack of explanation and/or justification may. If
accepted, the author will be awarded 7 reputation points and this example may
be added to their Final Portfolio. There is no penalty if the example is
rejected. In some instances, the definition will remain open for others to
submit additional (significantly different) examples up to an
instructor-designated limit. Likewise, occasionally propositions will have
immediate applications to specific cases. These are called corollaries and
proofs of corollaries must either use the statement or proof structure of the
proposition immediately preceding them. Otherwise, corollaries will be graded
and treated similar to examples.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:8.0pt;text-align:justify'><b><span
style='font-size:11.0pt'>Classroom Etiquette:</span></b><span style='font-size:
11.0pt'>   When critiquing submitted work in class, please provide polite and
constructive criticism. Refrain from saying unhelpful things such as “that’s
totally wrong,” or “that’s really dumb.” For very erroneous submissions, you
should try to find the very first incorrect statement, beyond which there is
often no need to discuss.</span></p>

style='font-size:11.0pt'>Final Portfolio of Written Work:         </span></b><span
style='font-size:11.0pt'>All written work (problem solutions and examples) that
are accepted should be compiled into one document that will be handed in at the
Final Exam. In other words, no new work is expected beyond organizing what
you’ve already done for the course. This portfolio will be graded on diversity
of proof types, difficulty of problems solved, and quality of examples. An
ideal Final Portfolio would contain at least one problem solution and example
from each section, at least one solution in each proof type, a handful of
solutions that involve longer strings of reasoning, and a handful of nontrivial
examples. A detailed rubric for the Final Portfolio can be found in the content
section of D2L.</span></p>

an enhanced standing while negative behavior results is a loss. At the
beginning of the semester, all students will start with 25 reputation points.
At any point (including the end of the semester) your grade for reputation will
be determined as a percentage of the top quartile, and then scaled to the
appropriate course points. Reputation Points can be earned or loss in the

speak with the instructor early in the semester about your concerns and what we
can do together to help you become an active and engaged member of our class

<ul type=disc>
 <li class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt'>Two good places to help you
     find resources of all kinds on campus are <i>Student Support/Campus
     Services</i> and the <i>Inclusion and Diversity Office</i>. Both offices
     are dedicated to helping students of all races, ethnicities, economic
     backgrounds, nationalities, and sexual orientations. They can facilitate
     tutoring and point you to a wide range of resources.&nbsp; </span></li>
 <li class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt'>If you have a disability,
     the <i>Access Services</i> office can document it for your professors and
     facilitate accommodations. If you have a documented disability that
     requires accommodation, please contact Access Services as soon as
     possible. </span></li>
 <li class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.0pt'>College can be very
     stressful. <i>Counseling</i> offices on both campuses are here to help you
     with a wide range of difficulties, ranging from sexual assault,
     depression, and grief after the loss of a loved one to stress management,
     anxiety, general adjustment to college, and many others.&nbsp; </span></li>

     incidents on campus and working with the appropriate channels to get these
     incidents resolved.</span></li>
