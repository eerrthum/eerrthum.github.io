<p class=MsoTitle>Degree Options in Mathematics</p>

</div>

<h1>Bachelor of Science in Mathematics</h1>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The B.S in Mathematics is designed for students who are considering
graduate school in mathematics or any technical field, or who want the
strongest possible background in terms of both breadth and depth of
mathematical knowledge.  This degree includes an independent research project.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The BS Mathematics Program provides students with an
extended program in the techniques, applications, and theories of mathematics.
Consequently, all BS mathematics majors must complete a significant amount of
course work beyond the Departmental Core. These additional courses are designed
to expose the student to a diverse range of mathematical topics, provide
in-depth rigorous study in a focused area, and supply the experience of an
independent project. The BS Mathematics major is designed to prepare students
for graduate school in mathematics, but also is suitable to prepare them to
enter other technical disciplines. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>For more information see the <a
href="http://catalog.winona.edu/preview_program.php?catoid=12&amp;poid=2674">WSU
Catalog: MATH BS</a>.</p>

<h1>Bachelor of Arts in Mathe<span class=Heading1Char>matics</span></h1>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The B.A. in Mathematics requires fewer mathematics courses
than the B.S., but instead requires a minor or major in a different program or
department.  The B.A. major is designed for students who want to combine
complementary interests and skills, learning to apply mathematics to another
field or area.  Majors in Mathematics Education or Statistics need only a few
additional courses to obtain the B.A. in Mathematics as a second major.  Other
fields that pair especially well with the B.A. in Mathematics are computer
science, physics, engineering, biology, and economics; but a minor in any
discipline is acceptable.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The BA Mathematics Program provides students with
instruction in the basic techniques, applications, and theories of mathematics.
Consequently, all BA mathematics majors must complete the Departmental Core and
four courses in advanced mathematical theory. Beyond this, students choose from
electives, which are designed to complement another major or minor, prepare for
future graduate work in the sciences, or provide coursework that is specific to
the needs of industry. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Students currently majoring or planning to major in other
disciplines are strongly urged to consider adding a major or minor in
mathematics as a useful means of preparing for professional exams, such as the
MCAT; as a way of creating an undergraduate program that sets the student apart
from others in that discipline when competing for future employment; and as a
way of increasing options for future graduate work.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>For more information see the <a
href="http://catalog.winona.edu/preview_program.php?catoid=12&amp;poid=2558">WSU
Catalog: MATH BA</a>.</p>

<h1>Minor in Mathematics</h1>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Minor in Mathematics is highly attractive to potential
employers or graduate schools in other disciplines, and recognizes students
majoring in other fields who have demonstrated significant mathematical skills
and knowledge.  Majors in Engineering need only one or two additional courses
to obtain the Minor in Mathematics.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>For more information see the <a
href="catalog.winona.edu/preview_program.php%3fcatoid=12&amp;poid=2577">WSU
Catalog: MATH Minor</a>.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Even if you do not want to minor in Mathematics, please
consider taking one more mathematics course beyond your major requirements! 
Any mathematics professor and/or your advisor can help clarify which
mathematics courses would be most relevant to your major and interests.</p>
